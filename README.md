Create a comprehensive tabulation of the types, shadows, and foreshadowings found in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, and show their direct connections to modern events, conditions, and experiences in our day. For each row in the table, include three parts: (1) the original Book of Mormon event/teaching with context, (2) the modern-day fulfillment or parallel it foreshadows, and (3) the ultimate or last-days fulfillment if relevant. Use precise scriptural references (with chapter and verse) and link to the official online scriptures. Ensure the table is as comprehensive and detailed as possible, covering themes such as secret combinations, the pride cycle, prophetic warnings, the gathering of Israel, social collapse, polarization, Christ’s ministry, covenant keeping, and final destruction or redemption. Present the table in a clear, structured format for study, showing the continuity of God’s dealings with His children across dispensations.
